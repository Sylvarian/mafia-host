# Domain layer

[AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) is the architecture authority. This directory owns the
framework-independent game model and rules.

Phase 1 introduces identifiers, players, roles, game settings and state, the explicit phase
machine, invariant validation, a small command/event reducer, and injected randomness. Role
abilities, assignment, action collection, resolution, voting, and win evaluation remain owned by
later phases.

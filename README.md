# Mafia Host

Mafia Host is a host-operated web application for running in-person Mafia games. It is intended to
replace the host's pen-and-paper bookkeeping while players remain together in the same room and use
physical role and result cards.

## Current status

Phase 3 — Role assignment and physical card distribution — is implemented. After preparing an
immutable Phase 2 setup, the host can create a random private assignment, see stable numbered
duplicate roles, record every physical card delivery, deliberately reassign before confirmation,
and finalise distribution only after all cards are handed out. The resulting active `GameState`
remains in `role-distribution`; Phase 4 night-action collection has not started.

Executioner role instances may be distributed, but their target is explicitly left unset because
target eligibility remains unresolved under R-008. No night actions, deaths, trials, or victory
logic are part of the current implementation.

## Requirements

- Node.js 24.x (LTS)
- npm 11.x or another npm version supplied with Node.js 24

The required Node major is recorded in `.nvmrc` and the `package.json` `engines` field.

## Local setup

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Vite prints the local development URL. Before submitting a change, run the same checks used by CI:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run format:check
npm test
npm run build
```

## npm commands

| Command                | Purpose                                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`          | Start the Vite development server.                                   |
| `npm run build`        | Type-check all TypeScript projects and create the production bundle. |
| `npm run typecheck`    | Run strict TypeScript project checks without emitting files.         |
| `npm run lint`         | Run ESLint and all Dependency Cruiser architecture rules.            |
| `npm run boundaries`   | Run only the dependency-boundary checks.                             |
| `npm run format`       | Format supported repository files with Prettier.                     |
| `npm run format:check` | Verify formatting without changing files.                            |
| `npm test`             | Run Vitest once in non-watch mode.                                   |
| `npm run test:watch`   | Run Vitest in watch mode for local development.                      |
| `npm run preview`      | Serve the production bundle locally after a build.                   |

## Architecture

The required dependency direction is shown below. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) remains the architecture
authority; this is only an orientation summary.

```text
features/UI
    ↓
application
    ↓
domain

infrastructure adapters
    ↓
application/domain contracts
```

- `src/domain` owns framework-independent game rules and may depend only on domain code.
- `src/application` coordinates domain behavior and may depend on domain code.
- `src/features` owns host workflows and calls application APIs. Slice internals stay private;
  cross-slice access must use an explicit public `index` module.
- `src/infrastructure` owns browser-specific randomness and identity adapters. They are composed
  at `App.tsx` and cannot be imported by application or feature internals.
- `src/shared/ui` is reserved for presentational components reused by at least two independent
  features.

Imports use the `@/*` alias for `src/*`, configured consistently in TypeScript and Vite.

Dependency Cruiser was selected for automated boundary enforcement because it analyses the actual
TypeScript import graph, resolves TypeScript path aliases, provides declarative rules, and directly
supports peer-folder isolation. `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` prevents upward layer imports, direct
UI-to-domain imports, cross-feature internal imports, React/CSS/routing imports in domain or
application code, imports from production code into tests, unresolved imports, and circular
dependencies. The boundary check runs as part of `npm run lint`. Its architecture test proves
relative and alias-based forbidden imports fail, permits explicit feature public APIs, and confirms
its deliberately invalid fixtures are excluded from normal production analysis.
ESLint separately rejects browser globals and global randomness in domain/application modules
because those dependencies do not appear in an import graph.

The layer-specific README files point back to the architecture authority. Phase 3 consumes the
exact validated Phase 2 snapshot, creates one authoritative active game through domain invariants,
and keeps physical delivery state in a focused immutable application workflow.
